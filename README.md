## Summary
The advantages of refactoring code is that you already have code written to work off of. The disadvantage of refactoring code is that it may prove to be more of an issue to get the code to run properly.
The VBA Code reader is not very intuitive when it comes to helping debug your code so refactoring can really be challenging. However if you already have script written it is easy to research numerous improvements that can be made to your existing code.
